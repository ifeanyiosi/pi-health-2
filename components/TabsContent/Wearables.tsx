              Wearables transmit real-time, ailment-specific vitals to the app
              and cliniciansâ€™ interface, allowing users to maintain their
              lifestyle without being hospital or bed-bound. These devices
              seamlessly integrate with the app, offering continuous monitoring
              of key health indicators such as{" "}
              <span className="font-medium text-gray-800">heart rate</span>,{" "}

              This data empowers clinicians to detect early warning signs,
              adjust treatment plans remotely, and provide personalized care
              recommendations without the need for frequent in-person visits.
              Users can also receive instant alerts for critical health events,
              enabling timely intervention and reducing the risk of
              complications.
